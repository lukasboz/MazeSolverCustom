# Custom Maze Solver (with pathway drawn)
This GitHub project, showcases an updated, improved, and refined "find shortest path" algorithm made for navigating through extremely intricate mazes. Coins are now required to enter doors, meaning some paths may not exist at all depending on program arguments.
Graphics have been improved. This version uses an adjacency matrix to store the graph nodes, but a version with an adjacency list is more efficient on memory. Unless the program arguments passed exceed a 1000x1000 grid, memory should not be an issue for this program.
